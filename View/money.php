    <h3 id="money">I have spent a total of $1100 on League of Legends
    since August 27th, 2015 when I started playing....
    <br>
    I have also logged around 1100 hours since August 27th, meaning that 
    I spend a dollar for every hour played... that (since I play SOLELY) at 
    Geneva, I have spent 37 full days of my Geneva career playing this game.
    <br>
    Please help me....
